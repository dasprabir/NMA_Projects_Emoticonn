# NMA_Projects_Emoticonn
This is our project on Analysing emotion processing in brain using fMRI with the help of effective and functional connectivity presented at Neuromatch Academy Summer School 

# Abstract

# Background
The primary aim of our project is to describe the difference in functional and effective
connectivity patterns in specific ROIs of the brain while processing emotional and neutral
stimuli.

# Hypothesis
We want to investigate the differences in BOLD activities for the ROIs for two different
conditions in emotion task and perform some statistical testing on that. We hypothesize
that connectivity of these regions should be different for the two different conditions
(neutral and emotion processing.

# Methods
Studying statistical association between two different time series signals (BOLD
response) for two different conditions.
o After that Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient based functional connectivity measures
will be computed
o We will then compute effective connectivity using Granger Causality.
o Binarizing our connectivity matrices to compute brain networks with the help of
graph theory can be done. (Future)

# Expected Results
We expect higher BOLD signal response in the above-mentioned ROIs while processing
anger/fearful stimuli.
